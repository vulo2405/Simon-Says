Simon Says by Verilog on FPGA

Game Tutorial:

LED light in the middle: 
1. No light - Simon doesn't say - Do not push buttons - Don't "hold ..."
2. Blue light - Simon says - Push buttons according to the FPGA - "hold ..."
3. Green light - Win round (win 10 rounds wins the game) - "good job"
4. Red light - Lose round and lose game - "try again"
